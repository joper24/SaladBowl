# SaladBowl
iOS Application using SwiftUI - Salad Bowl Group Game
This project is a hobby of mine that I have been working on in my spare time in order to improve my iOS development skills.

# What is salad bowl?
- Salad bowl is a group game with teams of two.
- It starts by picking a random letter. Every player is then given 6-8 pieces of paper. Then, each player will write down a word that is either a person, place, or thing, and starts with the random letter. Note that the words cannot be shared with one another.
- Round One: Verbal Clues
The player picks a word from the bowl and describes it to his teammates without saying the actual word. Once the word is correctly guessed, he can select another word from the bowl for his teammates to guess. He continues picking, describing each word for his teammates to guess, until his 1 minute turn is up.
- Round Two: Two Word Clue
For this round, a player picks a word from the bowl and gives 2 clues to get their teammate to guess the correct word. 
- Round Three: Charades
In this next round, the player picks a word from the salad bowl and must act it out without talking. Once itâ€™s guessed, they pick a new word and continues until their 1 minute turn is up. The team with the most points after all three rounds wins.

# App Goal
The goal of this application is to create an app for people to play this, without the need for paper.
